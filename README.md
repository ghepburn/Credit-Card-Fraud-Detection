# Python-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Classification

Using Python's Pandas & Scikit-Learn libraries a logistic machine learning classifier was created and trained on a large credit card dataset. The classifier identifies each transaction as being fraudulent or not. 

The dataset is from Kaggle and is includes unlabelled data.  This caused a large focus of the project to be on data cleaning and manipulation.
