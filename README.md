# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

A project for the course Make Money With MAchine Learning by Siraj Raval

Using a largley unlabelled kaggle dataset on hundreds of credit card transactions I applied data cleaning and preparation techniques using
the Python Pandas library and then developed a logistic regression classifior in SKLearn to deem transactions as fraudulent or not.
